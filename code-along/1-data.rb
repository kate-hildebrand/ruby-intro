# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb
# puts "Hello, world" - remove the "#" to activate the put-s

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
#puts 7.77

# Perform simple math with numbers
# puts 5 + 2

# Strings
#puts "tacos"

# Combine strings together
#puts "#{3+3+3} tacos"

# Variables
quantity = 3+3+3
food = "tacos"

# Combine strings and variables
#puts "#{quantity} #{food}"

# String manipulation
#puts "Hello".upcase
#puts "Hello".reverse
#puts "Hello".swapcase
